# Python Django Docker Demo

This project contains emerged from exploratory coding in Python with the Django
and Django Rest Framework. It contains some API endpoints in different styles. It
also has a docker-compose file which can be run with `docker-compose up` and will
bring up the python service as well as a postgres database for it to talk to.
(You must have docker and docker-compose installed!)
